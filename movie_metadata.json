    "synopsis": [
      "In Bangalore, Police Inspector Joseph (Jithu Ashraf) of the Karnataka Police is found dead in his home after leaving a suicide note orchestrated by a gang of drug addicts led by Christy (Vishak Nair).Eight months later, in Kerala, Circle Inspector Harishankar / Hari (Kunchacko Boban) is a hot-headed and impulsive officer who was recently demoted from his Deputy Superintendent of Police (DYSP) rank after assaulting an IPS superior. Hari is a brutal officer, who does not hesitate from using physical force on female suspects as well. DYSP Shahul Raj (Vaisakh Shankar) is the only senior officer who protects Hari from official reprimands against his actions.Hari is subsequently assigned as the Inspector Station House Officer (SHO) of the Aluva police station. He receives a complaint about a KSRTC bus conductor named Chandrababu (Jagadish) attempting to mortgage an imitation gold chain. Chandrababu says that he had bought the chain for his daughter's birthday, but when he went to mortgage it, the bank said that it is made of fake gold. Chandrababu claims that it is claims who switched the chain. He claims to have bought the chain on Aug 2nd, 2022, from a reputed jewelry store.\nChandrababu says that he wanted to mortgage the chain because he needed funds for his wife's surgery.\nThis seemingly minor case leads him to investigate a series of gruesome crimes, which are revealed to be connected to his own past personal tragedy.Hari suffers from PTSD following the suicide of his elder daughter, Nila (Meenakshi Anoop), which causes him to express his trauma violently, particularly toward his wife, Geetha (Priyamani). Upon investigation, Hari finds that Chandrababu is telling the truth, and he indeed bought the gold chain. Hari discovers that Chandrababu's teenage daughter had switched the chain herself after being sexually exploited by an unknown perpetrator.Hari searches for the original chain at all the gold and pawn shops in the city and finds that it had indeed been pawned by a woman named Haseena. Haseena is found to be out of town, but she had pawned another chain at the same time, which was originally bought by Jospeh. Hari meets Joseph's wife (Sheethal Thambi) who says that she is convinced that her husband did not commit suicide. She also says that the chain was bought for her daughter Angel Joseph (Angel), who claims that it was snatched by a biker. Hari suspects that Angel was sexually exploited too.Along with these 2 chains, there was a 3rd chain as well, and as Hari starts to get details of that chain, the matter is escalated to Shahul. Shahul tries to send Hari for training in Hyderabad, but he refuses.Hari attempts to file a POCSO case, but before he can proceed, the girl commits suicide by hanging. Chandrababu blames Hari for his rude behavior and his daughter's death. Witnessing her death triggers Hari's buried trauma, revealing that Nila had also been sexually exploited in the same way as Chandrababu's daughter. In a fit of rage, Hari kills a drug addict named Shyam (Ramzan Muhammed) in custody after discovering a sex tape of Nila on his laptop. Shyam also had obscene video of Inspector Thomas' daughter as well and was taunting them both.\nOvercome with grief, Hari attempts to confront Nila, but she had already hung herself in her room. The trauma causes him to suffer amnesia regarding the incident. The 3rd chain recovered belonged to Nila.In the present, Christy and his gang goes to Assistant Sub-Inspector Thomas, a recently released policeman who had taken the blame for Shyam's custodial death. Thomas had done so in an attempt to protect Hari since his own daughter had also been exploited by Shyam.To avenge Shyam's death, Christy and his gang murders Thomas and his wife, but before dying, Thomas's wife reveals that Hari was the one who actually killed Shyam. Thomas was also livid at his own daughter's death and exploitation and believed that Hari did the right thing.\nThe gang includes Christy, Lance (Amit Eapen), Anna, Celine, and Sathya (Vishnu G Varrier).Hari looks at the crime scene and deduces that Thomas and his wife did not commit suicide by poisoning themselves and were rather murdered. He points to several clues that do not corroborate the suicide theory, such as the waste bin had 4 lemons squeezed which means drinks were prepared for more than just 2 people.Hari speaks to Angel and wants to know who exploited her. She says that she was drugged and sexually assaulted by a Tamil boy who took away her gold chain as well. Hari then tracks down Haseena who says that she found the 3 chains in some abandoned clothes at a retail store. Checking the CCTV camera of the store, Hari finds that the clothes belonged to Anna.\nAs Hari heads to the store, he is tracked by Christy's gang. Christy decides that since Anna has been identified, they should retreat to Bangalore.Hari tracks down Anna (Aishwarya Raj), a member of Christy's gang, following her to Bangalore. A chase ensues, and Anna is fatally struck by a truck. Later, Christy and his gang attempt to ambush Hari in the mortuary, but he successfully fends them off after a brutal fight.As the investigation unfolds, Hari discovers that Joseph had once arrested Shyam, Celine (Leya Mammen), Anna, after catching them for using drugs and slapping a girl's mother on a bus where Chandrababu was the conductor. While in custody, Joseph sexually assaulted both Anna and Celine, leading Christy's gang to seek revenge on those responsible. Their revenge plan involved exploiting the women closest to those who contributed to their arrest. They began by targeting Joseph's daughter, Chandrababu's daughter and also Nila.\nChandrababu is met by Shahul and shown the evidence, but he is adamant that only Hari is responsible for killing his daughter and that the police are trying to protect him.It is revealed that Geetha and Nila were the mother and daughter, who had been slapped by them and Geetha was the one who initially confronted the gang, making them a target. Geetha believes that Hari is trying to deflect responsibility for Nila's death to someone else and leave him.Christy stabs Chandrababu and eventually tracks down Geetha and her younger daughter Minnu Hari (Eithal Evana Sherin), at her father's farmhouse. Christy and his gang attempts to kill them, but Geetha's father (Raghunath Paleri), a former army officer, fights back. He is ultimately killed by Christy. Geetha and Minnu tries to escape from them, but Christy follows them alone and he stabs Geetha. Minnu escapes from him but he follows her and reaches a small building in the woods. His gang also arrives and before they can make a move, Hari arrives and a final showdown ensues. Hari brutally beats them. He nearly kills Christy for what he did to his and Chandrababu's family.A few months later, Hari got back to his normal life and began to focus more on his family. Meanwhile, Christy and his gang is released on bail and plans their next attempt to kill Hari. However, Hari anticipates their move and laces their drugs with poison, ultimately killing the entire gang."

      "After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.",
      "Bound by an inescapable blood debt to the Italian crime lord, Santino D'Antonio, and with his precious 1969 Mustang stolen, John Wick--the taciturn and pitiless assassin who thirsts for seclusion--is forced to visit Italy to honour his promise. But, soon, the Bogeyman will find himself dragged into an impossible task in the heart of Rome's secret criminal society, as every killer in the business dreams of cornering the legendary Wick who now has an enormous price on his head. Drenched in blood and mercilessly hunted down, John Wick can surely forget a peaceful retirement as no one can make it out in one piece.—Nick Riganas"

    "synopsis": [
      "John Wick recovers his stolen Ford Mustang from Abram Tarasov, the late Viggo's brother.[a] Wick dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage that heavily damages the Mustang but spares Tarasov under the promise of peace and returns home. Wick has his Mustang taken for repairs by chop-shop owner Aurelio.John is visited by the Camorra crime boss Santino D'Antonio, who reminds him that he helped John complete his \"impossible task,\" which allowed John to retire and marry Helen. In return, John swore to a \"marker,\" an unbreakable vow symbolized by a \"blood oath\" medallion. Santino presents the marker to demand services from John, who declines, so Santino retaliates by destroying John's house with a grenade launcher. John survives and travels to the Continental Hotel in New York City. Winston, the hotel's owner, reminds him that if he rejects the marker, he will violate one of the underworld's two unbreakable rules: no killing on Continental grounds and honoring every marker, and if anyone refuses, they will be excommunicated. John reluctantly accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister, Gianna, so that he can claim her seat at the \"High Table,\" a council of twelve high-level crime bosses. Santino sends Ares, his mute bodyguard, to observe John's mission.In Rome, Italy, John infiltrates Gianna's coronation, confronting her in her dressing room. Faced with certain death, Gianna chooses to slit her wrists. As Gianna dies, John shoots her in the head to end her suffering and fulfill the marker. As John leaves, Gianna's bodyguard, Cassian, recognizes him, realizes that he was sent to kill Gianna, and attacks him. John flees to the catacombs, where he is double-crossed by Ares and Santino's henchmen, who intend to kill him. After killing most of the henchmen, Cassian pursues John again. Their fight leads them into the Rome Continental's reception area, where \"conducting business\" is strictly forbidden, as it is in the New York Continental. As the two share a drink, John explains his reason for killing Gianna. Nevertheless, Cassian promises John a quick and clean death as a sign of professional respect.Julius, Rome's Continental manager, arranges safe passage for John back to New York as Santino opens a contract to kill John, ostensibly to avenge his sister's death. This leads numerous assassins to unsuccessfully attack John, during which Winston visits Santino to complete the marker, thus freeing John from being unable to move against him. Winston warns Santino that he \"stabbed the devil in the back\" and that he will be unprepared for John's wrath.Injured from numerous attempted assassinations, John is then confronted by Cassian in the subway. After a vicious fight culminating in Cassian being stabbed in the aorta, John spares him. The badly injured John seeks help from an underground crime boss, the Bowery King, whose subordinates treat John's injuries. Intrigued by John's intent to kill a member of the High Table, the Bowery King sportingly gives him a Kimber M1911 pistol with only seven bullets, one for each million of the contract. He directs John to an art museum where Santino holds a gala. John pursues Santino throughout the museum, killing his henchmen, including Ares, who gives Santino enough time to escape to the Continental, where he intends to remain indefinitely in its sanctuary. Despite Winston's warnings, the exasperated John kills Santino in the Continental lounge.The next day, Winston meets with John and explains that the Camorra has doubled the contract on John, offering it globally. Further, for \"conducting business\" on Continental grounds, per the High Table's rules, Winston is forced to declare John \"excommunicado,\" terminating all his access and privileges to underworld resources. However, Winston delays activating John's excommunication by one hour (giving him a head start) and provides him with a marker for future use. Before leaving, John advises Winston to warn every other High Table assassin that he will kill anyone who tries to hunt him. John departs with his dog as Winston calls to enact John's \"excommunicado\" to be activated in one hour. As news of the imminent contract disseminates, cellular phones ring around John, and he begins to run."

They by chance meet the King of Ghosts and he gives them three boons for their simplicity and innocence. The first boon: they will get food whenever they want; the second boon: they can go anywhere they want; and the third boon: they will master art of music and everybody will be spellbound and motionless while they sing. Only for the first two boons they have to clap each other's hand. They travel by clapping to the kingdom of Shundi to participate in a music competition, which they win, and they become the King's court musicians. They find out that all the people in Shundi except the family of the King were dumb because of an epidemic. Unfortunately, in the kingdom of Halla, governed by the King of Shundi's brother, the minister drugs the innocent King and prepares to wage war against Shundi. He engages his chemist to prepare a cure for the dumbness of the people of Shundi. The reason is strange. According to him, \"If the people of Shundi don't say what they need, then how can I bar them from having that?\" Gupi and Bagha journey to Halla and things start to happen.—Somak Dutta"

      "In a future Earth in which aliens are isolated in a remote ghetto, a government agent finds himself banished there.",
      "In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed \"The Prawns,\" appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)"

    "synopsis": [
      "In 1982, a giant extraterrestrial spaceship arrives at Earth and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg. The doors didn't open for 3 months and finally A human investigation team (who cuts through the doors to enter the spacecraft) finds over one million malnourished aliens (derogatorily called \"Prawns\") inside, and the South African government relocates them to a terrestrial camp called District 9. However, over the years it turns into a slum, and locals from Earth often complain that the aliens are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans.Sarah Livingstone (Nathalie Boltt), a sociologist at Kempton Park University was part of the first contact team. The camp was supposed to be temporary, but since there was no plan, district 9 became permanent. Michael Bloemstein (Vittorio Leonardi), MNU Department of Alien Civil Affairs knows that the aliens are here to stay. Dirk Michaels (William Allen Young), the CEO of MNU.\nIt is theorized that the ship is inoperable as its command module detached and mysteriously \"disappeared\".20 yrs since their arrival, and Following unrest between the aliens and locals (Locals want the aliens gone, as they have acquired arms and are resorting to crime), the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a huge weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens (now 1.8 MM of them) to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar), an MNU executive, appoints MNU employee and his son-in-law Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) (a mild-mannered, bumbling, awkward bureaucrat at the MNU Department of Alien Affairs), to lead the relocation. The \"prawns\" resist and the relocation goes slow.Nigerians are running many scams in district 9, including selling cat food to aliens, cross species prostitution and alien weapons. They are headed by Obesandjo. Many people believed that MNU's plan to relocate the aliens was a cover to get hands on alien weapons, which are bio-engineered to their DNA and hence cannot be operated by humans. Nigerians have the biggest cache of alien weapons, which they have amassed for 20 yrs, without the ability to use them. Obesandjo kills and eats aliens, believing that it would give him the power to use alien weapons.Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), his young son CJ, and Christopher's friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last twenty years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan.\nThey finally finish in Paul's shack as the relocation begins, but when Wikus comes to the shack to serve Paul a notice, he finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his own face while confiscating it. Paul is killed by Koobus Venter (David James), a cruel leader of the MNU mercenaries who takes pleasure in killing the aliens.Wikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm, which was injured after the fuel exposure, and which was hidden under a large bandage. After playing down his symptoms (vomiting, nosebleed, headache, and fingernail and tooth loss), he passes out and is taken to a hospital where his left hand is now discovered to have become a prawn claw. He is transferred to the MNU lab, where researchers perform brutal experiments and discover his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, that is biologically restricted for use only by the aliens (humans are biologically unable to make the alien weapons work).\nWanting to capture this human/alien Hybridity before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders for Wikus's body to be vivisected and harvested for its profitable properties. Wikus, however, overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Koobus Venter's forces hunt for him, a smear story is broadcast on television, one that reaches Wikus' wife (who is Smit's daughter) Tania (Vanessa Haywood), claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a contagious disease from copulating with aliens.Wikus takes refuge in District 9 (since this is only place not under constant surveillance by the humans), accidentally finding Christopher and the mother spaceship's concealed command module drop-ship underneath his slum house. Christopher explains to Wikus that the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the drop-ship, and if he can get them in the drop-ship to the mothership, he can cure Wikus and reverse his physical transformation. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo (Eugene Wanangwa Khumbanyiwa), who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm because he believes it will grant him alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and, able to use it, escapes with a collection of weapons he and Christopher can use to attempt a retrieval of the alien fuel.Wikus and Christopher then force their way through MNU to the lab and retrieve the fuel. However, after seeing the barbaric experiments MNU has performed on his people in the lab (including a dissected Paul), Christopher tells Wikus he must return home as fast as possible for help and cannot undo Wikus' mutation until he returns in three years, due to the limited supply of the fuel. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher down and attempts to fly the drop-ship module to the mothership himself, but it is shot down by Koobus Venter's forces. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy, seizes Wikus, and brings Wikus to Obesandjo, who prepares to chop off Wikus's prawn arm.Meanwhile, CJ, remaining hidden in the drop-ship, remotely activates the mothership and a large, alien, mechanized battle suit located in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians, and Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries. Heading to the drop-ship, the two come under heavy human weapons fire, and Wikus stays behind to fend off the mercenaries, buying time for Christopher, who promises to return after three years and heal Wikus, to leave. After all of the other mercenaries are killed, Venter finally cripples the suit and is about to execute Wikus when slum aliens attack and dismember him alive. Christopher makes it into the drop-ship with CJ, and the drop-ship is levitated via a tractor beam back into the mothership, which Christopher then uses to leave Earth.Humanity is left to speculate whether or not Christopher will return to take all the remaining aliens back to their home world, or if he will return to declare war on Earth. MNU's experiments on the alien population are exposed, and the aliens are moved to the new camp, named District 10. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive, and a now fully-transformed Wikus is shown in a junkyard crafting the flower for his wife."
